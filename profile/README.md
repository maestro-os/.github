# About

Maestro is a lightweight Unix-like kernel written in Rust.

The goal is to provide a lightweight operating system able to use the safety features of the Rust language to be reliable.

> This project is still in early stage development, thus it is highly unstable and misses a lot of features. **Do not use it in production!**
